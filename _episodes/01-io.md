## Reading files

Reading files in python uses `for` loops. As a refresher, here is a simple `for` loop in Python:

~~~
for letter in 'ABCDEFGHIJ':
    print(letter)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Working with files is a two-step process. We first need to 'open' the file. Then, we can 'read' it line by line. 
There is some special syntax for opening files in Python. Behind the scenes, this special sytnax makes sure that the file is
closed again when we are done with it, and that the working memory it occupies becomes freed up for use again. This is the 
general recipe for reading a file:

~~~
with open('my_file') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Try it out! `my_file` is the *path* to the file you want to open. 

> ## Open a fastq file
> Fill in the blanks below to open and print the contents of your sample.fastq file
> ~~~
> with open('__________/sample.fastq') as f:
>     for line in ___:
>         print(____)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
{: .challenge}

There is nothing special about `f` or `line`, we can use any legal variable names here. This should also work:

~~~
with open('afds/py_scripts/data/sample.fastq') as fluffy:
    for unicorn in fluffy:
        print(unicorn)
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Processing file contents

So, we can read and print the contents of a file. What else can we do? Try this:

~~~
with open('afds/py_scripts/data/sample.fastq') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(type(line))
~~~
{: .language-python}

So, lines are read in as strings, which means we can perform any string operations on them.

What does this program do?
~~~
with open('afds/py_scripts/data/sample.fastq') as f:
    for line in f:
        if line[0] == '@'
            line.split(' ')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Last week we spent some time extracting meta data from read headers in files. As you can see now, this is quite an easy task in Python!

## Writing to files

We now know how to read a file in Python and work with it line by line. We also know how to process these lines as strings, and extract the parts that we want. But how do we save this as output to a new file? 

Writing to a file uses the same `with open('my_file') as f:` notation:

~~~
acrostic = 'Perhaps You Thought Hackers Outnumber Nerds'
with open('poetry.txt', 'w') as f:
    for word in acrostic:
        f.write(word+'\n')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here, we have provided the **optional** argument `w` to the `open` function, which tells python we want to bring a 
new file into existence and write content into it. Warning: if you specify a file that already exists, and open it in 'write' 
mode using the `w` optional argument, your original file will be overwritten! By default, if you don't specify an argument, 
Python will open a file in read only, or `r` mode. There is a third mode, `a`. What does this do?

> ## Write to a file
> Fill in the blanks to write some code that splits read header information into relevant fields and saves the output as
> a nicely formated tab-delimited text file.
> ~~~
> with open('____/metadata.tsv', ___ ) as out_file:
>     out_file.write('machine', 'lane', 'tile', 'x-coord', 'y-coord', sep='___')
>     with open('_____/sample.fastq') as in_file:
>         for line in in_file:
>              seq_data = line.split()[__]
>              parts = seq_data._____(__)
>              out_file.write(_______)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}

## `For` loops consume files

What if you want to do two different things to the contents of a file? For instance, start by printing them, so you can see the file's contents, and then split the read headers, once you know what you are looking at. You might try:

~~~
with open('afds/py_scripts/data/sample.fastq') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
    for line in f:
        if line[0] == '@'
            print(line.split(' ')[1])
~~~
{: .language-python}

Try it. Does this work?

If you really want to be able to read in all your lines, and have them exist outside a for loop, there is a way:

~~~
with open('afds/py_scripts/data/sample.fastq') as f:
    lines=f.readlines()
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## readlines()
> You've just run the following code:
> ~~~
> with open('novel.txt') as file:
>     text=file.readlines()
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
> 
> 1. What is the type of `text`? Try out something similar on your fastq file to work this out. 
> 2. How do you access the 100th line of your novel?
> 3. Why might it not be a good idea to read a file like this?
> 4. In two separate examples, use readlines() and a `for` loop that extracts the 12th line of your fastq file. What are the
advantages / disadvantages of each?
> 5. There is another method that reads an entire file: `f.read()`. Have a play. What does this do?
{: .challenge}

In our exercise last week, to access metadata we only wanted to read the *first* line of the file, to get the read header. There is a function in Python to read a single line:

~~~
with open 'afds/py_scripts/data/sample.fastq') as f:
    l=f.readline()
    print(l)
~~~
{: .language-python}

What happens if you run `line=f.readline()` repeatedly?


## Listing files and regular expressions
We now have almost everything we need to process all our data files.
The only thing that's missing is a library with a rather unpleasant name:

~~~
import glob
~~~
{: .language-python}

The `glob` library contains a function, also called `glob`,
that finds files and directories whose names match a pattern, i.e. regular expression.
We provide those patterns as strings:
the character `*` matches zero or more characters,
while `?` matches any one character.

Log onto pearcey and open a Jupyter notebook. Navigate to the folder where your raw data is stored. 
We can use this to get the names of all the fastq files in the current directory:

~~~
print(glob.glob('*.fastq.gz'))
~~~
{: .language-python}

As these examples show,
`glob.glob`'s result is a list of file and directory paths in arbitrary order. This means we can loop over it
to do something with each filename in turn.

> ## File order
> How would you generate an ordered list of files?
{: .challenge}

> ## Challenge exercises
> 1. Write a python program that checks if two fastq files (from read 1 and read 2) have the same number of lines.
> 2. Turn the program in (1) into a function. 
> 3. Write a for loop to check that *all* the pairs of fastq files have the same number of lines. Hint: use your function!
{: .challenge}

> ## Extension exercise
> Write a Python program that processes two separate paired end read files and turns them into **one** *interleaved* file, where the four lines of the read from file 1 are directly followed by the four lines of the read from file 2. Hint: you will need to use the f.readlines() method, and a `while` loop.
