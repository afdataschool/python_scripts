We use the keyword 'class', followed by the new class's name, just as we would use the keyword 'def' and a 
name to create a function. We'll come back later and explain why we have put the word 'object' in parentheses 
after the class's name—for now, you'll just have to trust us. The body of this class is just the keyword 
'pass', meaning "do nothing", because we're not actually defining any behavior for things of this type.

first = Empty()
second = Empty()

{: .language-python}

We do this by "calling" the class's name as if it was a function. Each time we do this, Python goes and creates 
a new object of that class. We can assign those objects to variables to keep track of them, just as we've been 
assigning things to variables all along.

~~~
print('first is', id(first))
print('second id', id(second))

First, though, let's see how we teach classes to do things. To do this, we define one or more methods inside the class.
We define the class's behaviour with methods. 'Methods' are essentially functions defined within the class.

    def greet(self, name):
        print('hello', name)
